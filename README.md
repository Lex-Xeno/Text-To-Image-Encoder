# Text To Image Encoder

# What does this programme do?
----This programme takes a text string and encodes it into an image. There is also a decoder that does the opposite. P.S. This is my first GitHub post and this is a random project I made so it might not be the best.

# Explanation on how this programme works coming soon...

# What's next?
----Some optimisations.
----An explanation on how this programme functions.
----Adding in some precautions to prevent the VERY unlikely event that the programme generated a pixel that can be interpreted as a character.
