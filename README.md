# Text To Image Encoder

## What does this programme do?
This programme takes a text string and encodes it into an image. There is also a decoder that does the opposite. P.S. This is my first GitHub post and this is a random project I made so it might not be the best.

## What character are valid?
### Uppercase
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

### Lowercase
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z

### Symbols
'1', '!', '2', '"', '3', 'Â£', '4', '$', '5', '%', '6', '7', '&', '8', '*', '9', '(', '0', ')', '-', '_', '=', '+', '[', '{', ']', '}', ';', ':', ''', '@', '#', '~', '\', '|', ',', '<', '.', '>', '/', '?', 'space'

##  If you don't know what to put but want to test this programme use this:
> Welcome to Blender! Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite. With Blender, you can create 3D visualizations such as still images, 3D animations and VFX shots. You can also edit videos. It is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process. Being a cross-platform application, Blender runs on Linux, macOS, as well as Windows systems. It also has relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.

## What's next?
Some optimisations.

An explanation on how this programme functions.

Adding in some precautions to prevent the VERY unlikely event that the programme generated a pixel that can be interpreted as a character.

Adding in return as a character.

Making the README look better.
